# Peanut Shader Engine

A lightweight HLSL pixel shader renderer. Made with Win32 within a couple days to learn C++ and DirectX. Totally worth it.


## Features

- Renders pixel-shaders within a window.
- Elapsed time variable (for over time effects)
- Compilation log (if your code is perfect, you don't need this!)

## Roadmap

- Shader reload (no need to relaunch app to preview new shader)
- Instant screenshot

# Usage

1 - Write your shader within the "shaders.shader" file (must be in the same directory as the executable).

2 - Run "Peanut.exe"

3 - If your window simply renders white and you're not returning 1 check the "log.txt" file. It shows you compiler errors and gets reset every time you launch Peanut.
